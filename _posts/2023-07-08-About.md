## Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ)
![logo ICIQ](/assets/images/logoICIQ.png)

Founded in 2000 by the Government of Catalonia, the [Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ)](http://iciq.es)
started its research activities in 2004.

ICIQ is committed to performing excellent research at the frontier of knowledge in two main areas: Catalysis and 
Renewable Energy. The institute also has two other commitments: knowledge and technology transfer to the chemical, 
pharmaceutical and energy industrial sectors and that of training the future generation of scientists by offering 
high-quality educational programmes to master and PhD students as well as postdoctoral researchers.

Our mission is to lead, from the vantage point of molecular science, cross-strategies for solving major social and 
economic challenges, such as climate change and sustainable supply of energetic and raw materials, thereby contributing 
to the establishment of a knowledge-based economy and improving quality of life for all.

## ICIQ digitalization plan

Since the creation of the [ioChem-BD platform](https://www.iochem-bd.org/) in 2013, ICIQ has been compromised with the
digitalization of its research.

### ioChem-BD platform
First, [ioChem-BD](https://www.iochem-bd.org/) started its development in 2013 and had its second major release in 2020.

The [ioChem-BD software platform](https://www.iochem-bd.org/) is a suite of web services oriented to manage the entire
life-cycle of Computational Chemistry and Material Science digital files. 

**Please consider reading these papers regarding [ioChem-BD platform](https://www.iochem-bd.org/) and other related

### eChempad platform
Then, since 2021 another platform is currently under development: The [eChempad platform](http://github.com/AleixMT/eChempad).

[eChempad](http://github.com/AleixMT/eChempad) is a web application oriented to manage the entire data life-cycle of 
experiments and assays from Experimental Chemistry and related Science disciplines.

The [eChempad platform](http://github.com/AleixMT/eChempad) appears as an answer to the digitization needs of 
experimental chemists at [Institut Català d'Investigació Química (ICIQ)](https://www.iciq.org/). This platform intends 
to be an analogous example of the successful platform for **Computational Chemistry** developed at 
[ICIQ](http://iciq.es), [ioChem-BD](https://www.iochem-bd.org/index-introduction.jsp).

Currently, the [eChempad platform](http://github.com/AleixMT/eChempad) allows researchers to extract experimentation 
data from the
[PerkinElmer Signals Notebook](https://perkinelmerinformatics.com/products/research/signals-notebook-eln) in bulk,
enrich them with metadata, and finally publish them into [CORA RDR](https://dataverse.csuc.cat/) a
[Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) instance maintained by the
[Consorci de Serveis Universitaris de Catalunya (CSUC)](https://www.csuc.cat/en).
